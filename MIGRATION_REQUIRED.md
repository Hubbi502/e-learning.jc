# ⚠️ Database Migration Required

## IP Hash Security Feature Added

A new security layer has been added to the attendance system using IP address hashing.

### What Changed

1. **New Field Added to Attendance Model**
   - `ip_hash` (String, optional, indexed) - Stores hashed IP addresses for duplicate detection

### Migration Command

Run this command when your database is accessible:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_ip_hash_to_attendance
```

Or if you prefer:

```bash
npm run prisma migrate dev -- --name add_ip_hash_to_attendance
```

### What the Migration Does

- Adds `ip_hash` column to the `attendances` table
- Creates an index on `ip_hash` for performance
- Existing records will have `NULL` for `ip_hash` (which is fine)

### After Migration

1. **Generate Prisma Client** (usually automatic after migration):
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Restart your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Optional: Add IP Hash Salt

For additional security, add this to your `.env` file:

```env
IP_HASH_SALT=your-random-secret-salt-here
```

This salt will be used when hashing IP addresses. If not provided, the system works without it.

## New Security Architecture

The attendance system now has **Triple-Layer Security**:

1. **🔒 FingerprintJS** - Advanced browser fingerprinting
2. **🌐 IP Hash** - Hashed IP address validation
3. **🍪 HTTP-Only Cookies** - Cookie-based session tracking

All three layers work together to prevent duplicate attendance submissions while maintaining user privacy.
